Often, not enough data is given at the start of a project and it'll change in such a way that is no longer flexible with the current implementation strategy.

## Emerge

Optimizing for code deletion allows some nice properties to emerge.
Utilizing this method helps enforce a clean code base.


## Axe

There's fewer things more satisfying than utilizing a razor-sharp axe.
Grokking systems is a far easier task when they are simple and well named.

## Void
