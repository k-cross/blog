Hello! Welcome to my personal site.
I am a software engineer and talk about it often but dabble in mathematics, philosophy, and sciences too.
As a researcher, I am a novice.
My intent is for this site to serve as an outlet for research, opinions, and other creative endeavours.
Turning theoretical computer science topics into practical computing concepts is my professional goal.
The book _Making Software - What Really Works and Why we Believe It_ had a significant impact on my approach to software engineering, convincing me to write more thoughtfully because opinions are cheap.
Performing genuine research backed by data with analysis is hard.
I'd appreciate feedback, particularly on articles written after 2020 as I have grown a lot as an engineer since then.
Thank you for reading!
