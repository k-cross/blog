Interview practices of the software engineering industry should evolve but until they do, we're stuck with methods that leave talented people without work. There is a balancing act: some methods make it too easy to lie about your effectiveness without some form of coding challenge or, they're too demanding to be performed at scale, which leaves even more people out of the process due to time constraints. One of the things I dislike about interviews generally, is they optimize for people who are good thinking and operating in the moment. This is great if it's a job requirement (maybe active triage), but even when it is, the stress is different when you're worried about feeding your family as opposed to figuring out why production went down. I can emphatically say that the stress is different, and hits differently, at least for me, and I'm not entirely sure why. I'm perfectly happy telling leaders to fuck-off in an incident in order to get a site back up quicker, which also has damaging consequences, but after being a class tourist in college, it hits different when you feel what's at stake rather than hypothetical circumstances that could affect people you care most about. I consider myself somewhere in between. If you also consider yourself someone who is more prone to deep thinking as opposed to reciting answers, the good news is that you can improve. Understanding common algorithm patterns is one way to train your _fast brain_[^1], helping to develop intuition about the shape of specific types of problems. I will focus on the receiving side today and specifically, the coding challenges that I couldn't solve.

For me, there has been a silver lining of finally taking interviewing as a skill seriously, and that is that it has forced me to re-learn algorithms and data-structures. I loved them in college, the proofs, the math, but there were always a few that I never internalized. Being forced to revisit these is actually going to make me a better engineer, not because I'll be solving leet-code puzzles, but because I'll understand more problem shapes and areas where I can use specific patterns more effectively. This is the type of work that is most fun about software engineering. Usually you're stuck in the day to day requirements of fitting square pegs in round holes for products that never seem to get any real technical debt addressed.

One thing that I do regardless of interview performance, is make sure that I solve all the problems. If I know an interview is going badly, I remember the questions, write them down, and work through them without the pressure.

There were two problems that I came across recently during my interviews that forced me to reflect.
