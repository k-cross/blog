Hi, I'm Ken, a software engineer by trade.
Using theory to solve problems is a passion of mine, although you're more likely to find me fitting square pegs through round holes with sledge hammers at work.
You may know me by maintaining some software projects or as a contributor.
One day, I hope to write with higher frequency but for now, it's whatever time allows.
I am available for consulting, feel free to reach out.
Thank you!
