I am a software engineer researching language and compiler design, operating systems, and distributed algorithms but dabble in a wide range of mathematics, philosophy, and sciences too.
As a researcher, I am a novice.
The site's moniker _quasarken_ has been my handle for a long time and is the history behind the name.
My intent is for this site to serve as an outlet for research, opinions, and other creative endeavours.
Turning theoretical computer science topics into practical computing concepts is the professional goal that I'm striving to attain.
The book _Making Software - What Really Works and Why we Believe It_ has had a significant impact on my approach to software engineering.
It has convinced me to write more research rather than opinion pieces because opinions are cheap; performing genuine research backed by data with analysis is hard.
I'd appreciate feedback, particularly on articles written after 2020 as I have grown a lot as an engineer since then.
Thank you for reading!
