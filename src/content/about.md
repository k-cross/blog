Designed to serve as a creative outlet for mostly computer science and adjacent topics and their applications.
I am a _software engineer_ by trade with professional interests that span a variety of practical and academic fields, from woodworking to mathematics.
As a computer scientist, the things that truly peak my interest are language and compiler design, operating systems and algorithms.
When I'm not working, I'm probably commuting. But when I'm not doing that either, I'm usually playing with my awesome daughter somewhere around mountains or beaches.

Thank you for reading! I've provided social engineers and other parties of interest with the following reconnaissance material.
