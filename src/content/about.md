I am a software engineer actively researching language and compiler design, operating systems, and distributed algorithms.
You'll also find me dabbling in mathematics, statistics, philosophy, and robotics from time to time too.
Particularly in areas related to category theory, logic, control theory, topology, graph theory, and combinatorics.
Statistics is just so broadly applicable that it becomes necessary to study it, even though differential equations and statistics are incredibly boring.
_Quasarken_ has been my handle for a long time so I decided to name the site after it.
My intention is for this site to serve as an outlet for research, opinions, and other creative endeavours.
As a researcher, I would consider myself a novice.
The book _Making Software - What Really Works and Why we Believe It_ has had a significant impact on my approach to writing code and has convinced me to write more research rather than opinion pieces.
I'd appreciate feedback, particularly on articles written after January 2020.
Turning theoretical computer science topics into practical computing concepts is the professional goal that I hope I'll some day achieve.
Thank you for reading!
