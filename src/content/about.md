Hi, I'm Ken, a software engineer by trade.
Using theory to solve real world problems is a passion of mine.
You may know me by maintaining some software projects or as a contributor.
One day, I hope to write with higher frequency but for now, it's whatever time allows.
I am available for consulting, feel free to reach out for details.
Thank you!
